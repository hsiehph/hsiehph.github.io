    title: "About me"
    excerpt : '

<br/>I am a computational biologist interested in population genomics, human evolution, and evolutionary medicine. My research program focuses on understanding key evolutionary processes, such as hybridization and selection, that lead to genetic novelties in populations and studying mutation effects in humans. I am particularly interested in the evolution and fitness consequences of structural variants and building evolutionary applications for biomedical research. My research involves using long-read sequencing, designing statistical methods, and analyzing large multi-omics and simulated datasets.<br/><br/>

Currently, I am a NIH K99/R00 fellow with Dr. Evan Eichler at the University of Washington. I received my Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Arizona, working in the laboratories of Michael Hammer and Ryan Gutenkunst, with a strong emphasis in human evolution and population genetics. I received my M.S. in Computational Biology from the University of Southern California, CA. I also have a M.S. in Electrical Engineering (National Taiwan University, Taiwan) and a B.S. in Computer Engineering (National Central University, Taiwan). <br/><br/>

My full academic [CV](/assets/docs/CV_PingHsunHsieh202103.pdf) is available.
